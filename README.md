# enhance-music

Enhance Music is an audio library and music player built with [Enhance](https://enhance.dev) — the HTML first full stack web framework.

This example project is meant to demonstrate the kind of exceptional developer and user experiences that can be achieved by building with HTML and CSS, with a few pinches of progressive enhancement via JavaScript, and assistance with custom elements and web components via Enhance.

We invite you to explore the codebase, [try Enhance Music for yourself](https://enhance-music.com), and ping us with any questions on [the Enhance Discord server](https://enhance.dev/discord).

You can also read [the Enhance Music deep dive on the Begin blog](https://begin.com/blog/posts/TBA).
